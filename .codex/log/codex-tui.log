+# JulesJenga Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### I. Code Quality & Maintainability
+Every change MUST improve or preserve readability, maintainability, and safety. Mandatory practices: consistent formatting and linting; small, cohesive changes with clear intent; peer review before merge; inline documentation for non-obvious logic and public interfaces; dead code and unused flags removed. Rationale: disciplined code reduces defects, lowers onboarding cost, and keeps future changes fast.
+
+### II. Testing Discipline & Coverage
+Automated tests MUST accompany all functional changes: unit tests for logic, contract/integration tests for interfaces, and regression tests for found defects. Critical flows (auth, payments, data integrity) require explicit negative tests. Tests MUST be deterministic and run in CI; failing or flaky tests block release. Rationale: predictable releases depend on fast, trusted feedback.
+
+### III. User Experience Consistency & Accessibility
+Implementations MUST adhere to the agreed design system (layout, components, tokens, copy style) and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. All user-facing changes require UX acceptance criteria: consistent navigation, clear error states, resilient offline/poor-network behavior where applicable, and localized text handling. Rationale: consistent UX builds trust and reduces user friction across features.
+
+### IV. Performance & Efficiency Targets
+Each feature MUST define and honor performance budgets (e.g., p95 latency, frame rate, memory/CPU bounds) and confirm them with measurement. Hot paths require profiling before optimization; any regression beyond agreed budgets blocks release. Backward-incompatible performance trade-offs need documented approval and mitigation. Rationale: performance is a user-visible feature and protects operational costs.
+
+### V. Decision Traceability & Delivery Governance
+Material technical decisions MUST be traceable to these principles via ADRs or design notes, including options considered and their principle alignment. Coupling, complexity, or tech-debt acceptance requires explicit, time-bound remediation plans. Rationale: transparent decisions keep the system coherent and auditable.
+
+## Quality Standards & Non-Functional Requirements
+
+- Security, privacy, and compliance requirements inherit the strictest applicable policy; do not store or transmit secrets in logs or telemetry.
+- Dependencies MUST be current on security patches; deprecated packages require replacement plans before acceptance.
+- Observability: structured logs, actionable alerts, and minimal SLOs for availability and latency are required for any new surface.
+- Rollout safety: feature flags or gradual deployments are required for risky changes; rollback paths must be validated.
+
+## Development Workflow & Quality Gates
+
+- Definition of Ready: principle alignment checked, performance budgets defined, UX acceptance criteria captured, and test strategy agreed before implementation begins.
+- Definition of Done: code merged only after tests pass in CI, UX acceptance is verified, performance checks meet budgets, and documentation (code-level and user-facing where applicable) is updated.
+- Reviews: PRs must cite which principles are addressed; reviewers block merges when evidence is missing (tests, measurements, UX proof).
+- Releases: no releases with unresolved flaky tests, unmeasured performance risks, or UX guideline deviations without explicit, time-limited exceptions approved by engineering leadership.
+
+## Governance
+
+- Authority: This constitution supersedes other engineering practice documents for conflicting topics.
+- Amendments: Proposed via PR with redlines and rationale; require approval from engineering lead and one UX and one QA representative. Migration or remediation plans must accompany changes that alter obligations.
+- Versioning: Semantic versioning for this document (MAJOR for breaking/removal of principles, MINOR for new or expanded principles/sections, PATCH for clarifications). Last Amended updates on every accepted change.
+- Compliance: Feature plans and PR checklists must include a Constitution Check; periodic audits (at least quarterly) verify adherence, and gaps require tracked remediation tasks.

 ## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*
 
 <!--
   IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
   Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
   you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
 
   Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
   Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
   - Developed independently
   - Tested independently
   - Deployed independently
   - Demonstrated to users independently
+
+  Each story MUST include UX acceptance (alignment with design system + accessibility) and a measurable performance expectation where relevant.

+# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]
+
+**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
+**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
+
+**Tests**: Automated tests are REQUIRED for every functional change (unit plus integration/contract per interface). Add explicit regression tests for fixed defects.
+
+**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.
+
+## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
+
+- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
+- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
+- Include exact file paths in descriptions
+
+## Path Conventions
+
+- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
+- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
+- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
+- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure
+
+<!-- 
+  ============================================================================
+  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

+  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
+  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
+  - Feature requirements from plan.md
+  - Entities from data-model.md
+  - Endpoints from contracts/
+  
+  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
+  - Implemented independently
+  - Tested independently
+  - Delivered as an MVP increment
+  
+  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
+  ============================================================================
+-->
+
+## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)
+
+**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure
+
+- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
+- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
+- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools
+
+---
+
+## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)
+
+**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented
+
+**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete
+
+Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):
+
+- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
+- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
+- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
+- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
+- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
+- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management
+
+**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel
+
+---
+
+## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) MVP
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 1 (required)
+
+> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**
+
+- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 1
+
+- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
+- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
+- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
+- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
+- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations
+
+**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently
+
+---
+
+## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 2 (required)
+
+- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 2
+
+- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
+- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
+- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)
+
+**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently
+
+---
+
+## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 3 (required)
+
+- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 3
+
+- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
+- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
+- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+
+**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional
+
+---
+
+[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]
+
+---
+
+## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
+
+**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories
+
+- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
+- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
+- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
+- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests in tests/unit/
+- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
+- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation
+
+---
+
+## Dependencies & Execution Order
+
+### Phase Dependencies
+
+- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
+- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
+- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
+  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
+  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
+- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
+
+### User Story Dependencies
+
+- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
+- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
+- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
+
+### Within Each User Story
+
+- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
+- Models before services
+- Services before endpoints
+- Core implementation before integration
+- Story complete before moving to next priority
+
+### Parallel Opportunities
+
+- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
+- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
+- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
+- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
+- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
+- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
+
+---
+
+## Parallel Example: User Story 1
+
+```bash
+# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
+Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
+Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"
+
+# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
+Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
+Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
+```
+
+---
+
+## Implementation Strategy
+
+### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
+
+1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
+2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
+3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
+4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
+5. Deploy/demo if ready
+
+### Incremental Delivery
+
+1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
+2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
+3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
+4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
+5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories
+
+### Parallel Team Strategy
+
+With multiple developers:
+
+1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
+2. Once Foundational is done:
+   - Developer A: User Story 1
+   - Developer B: User Story 2
+   - Developer C: User Story 3
+3. Stories complete and integrate independently
+
+---
+
+## Notes
+
+- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
+- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
+- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
+- Verify tests fail before implementing
+- Commit after each task or logical group
+- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
+- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

+# Feature Specification: JulesJenga
+
+**Feature Branch**: `001-julesjenga`  
+**Created**: 2025-11-29  
+**Status**: Draft  
+**Input**: User description: "Create a mobile-friendly web app (plain HTML/JS/CSS) hosted on Firebase. Uses Firebase Authentication (handled externally) and Firestore. App name: JulesJenga. After login, greet user by name, show Start button, Upload button, dropdown of available question sets (shared between users). Question set = title + exactly 54 questions. Upload: text file where line 1 is title and lines 2–55 are questions; store in Firestore for persistence. Start: go to 6×9 grid numbered 1–54; tapping a tile opens the corresponding question; closing returns to grid; opened tiles marked. Opened tiles do not persist across sessions."
+
+## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*
+
+### User Story 1 - Choose and start game (Priority: P1)
+
+As an authenticated user, I want to pick a question set and start the game so I can play immediately.
+
+**Why this priority**: Core entry path for every game session.
+
+**Independent Test**: User can select a set from dropdown, press Start, and reach the grid with the chosen set loaded.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** user is authenticated and at the home screen, **When** they open the dropdown and choose a set, **Then** the selection is reflected and Start becomes enabled.
+2. **Given** a set is selected, **When** the user taps Start, **Then** they see a 6×9 grid labeled 1–54 loaded with that set’s questions (ready to open).
+
+### User Story 2 - Play through tiles (Priority: P1)
+
+As a player, I want to tap tiles to reveal questions and track which tiles were used during this session.
+
+**Why this priority**: Primary gameplay loop.
+
+**Independent Test**: From the grid, user taps any number 1–54, sees the right question, closes it, and the tile shows as used; state resets on reload.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** the grid is displayed, **When** the user taps tile 17, **Then** a modal shows question 17’s text with a close action.
+2. **Given** a question modal is open, **When** the user closes it, **Then** they return to the grid and tile 17 is visibly marked as used while other tiles remain untouched.
+3. **Given** the session ends or the page reloads, **When** the grid reappears, **Then** all tiles are unmarked (session-only state).
+
+### User Story 3 - Upload a question set (Priority: P2)
+
+As a user, I want to upload a text file with 54 questions and a title so it becomes available to everyone.
+
+**Why this priority**: Enables custom/shared content.
+
+**Independent Test**: User uploads a valid file; set appears in dropdown for all users after successful save; malformed files are rejected with clear error.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** the user taps Upload, **When** they select a valid file (55 lines), **Then** the app parses title + 54 questions, saves to Firestore, confirms success, and the new set appears in the dropdown (after refresh or auto-refresh).
+2. **Given** the user selects a file with missing lines, **When** upload is attempted, **Then** the app blocks the upload and shows a specific error (“expected 55 lines: 1 title + 54 questions”).
+3. **Given** network loss during upload, **When** save fails, **Then** the user sees a retry option and no partial set is listed.
+
+### Edge Cases
+
+- File has more or fewer than 55 lines: reject and show precise error.
+- Duplicate titles: allow but display both; note for UX disambiguation (e.g., timestamp).
+- Empty lines within the 54 questions: reject with specific error.
+- Long question text: enforce max length (e.g., 280 chars) and validate on upload.
+- Offline at app start: show error and retry; grid unusable without data.
+- Rapid tile taps: ensure only one modal opens at a time.
+
+## Requirements *(mandatory)*
+
+### Functional Requirements
+
+- **FR-001**: System MUST list all shared question sets from Firestore in a dropdown after login.
+- **FR-002**: System MUST require a selected set before enabling Start.
+- **FR-003**: System MUST render a 6×9 grid with tiles numbered 1–54.
+- **FR-004**: System MUST open the correct question in a modal when a tile is tapped.
+- **FR-005**: System MUST mark tiles as used after viewing; this state MUST reset on reload/new session.
+- **FR-006**: System MUST accept text file uploads where line 1 = title and lines 2–55 = questions; reject invalid counts.
+- **FR-007**: System MUST persist uploaded sets to Firestore and make them available to all authenticated users.
+- **FR-008**: System MUST show clear error states for malformed uploads, network failures, and missing data.
+- **FR-009**: System MUST display the user’s name from Firebase Auth on the home screen.
+
+### Non-Functional Requirements
+
+- **NFR-001**: UX MUST be smartphone-first responsive; touch targets ≥44px; modal accessible (focus trap, ESC/close), dropdown and buttons keyboard-focusable; color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA.
+- **NFR-002**: Performance budgets: home-to-grid navigation <1.5s p95 on 4G; modal open <150ms p95; grid interactions maintain <16ms frame time p95; upload parse <300ms, Firestore save <2s p95.
+- **NFR-003**: Reliability/observability: show user-facing spinners/progress for loads/uploads; log errors to console with actionable messages during development; handle retries for transient Firestore errors.
+- **NFR-004**: Security/privacy: enforce Firestore security rules so only authenticated users can read/write; uploaded content contains no secrets; no PII stored beyond Firebase Auth profile.
+- **NFR-005**: Shared sets: all authenticated users can read sets; writes create new sets; deletion/update policy TBD (default: no delete path yet).
+
+### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
+
+- **QuestionSet**: `{ id, title, questions[54], createdAt, createdBy }` in Firestore.
+- **UI State (ephemeral)**: `{ activeSetId, openedTileIds[] }` held in memory (not persisted).
+
+## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*
+
+### Measurable Outcomes
+
+- **SC-001**: 95% of users reach the grid from home within 1.5s on 4G.
+- **SC-002**: 95% of modal opens occur within 150ms from tile tap.
+- **SC-003**: 0 invalid (non-55-line) files are accepted; 100% show clear error.
+- **SC-004**: 100% of uploaded valid sets appear in dropdown for another authenticated user within 5s.
+- **SC-005**: Mobile usability: ≥90% of test participants (or heuristic check) can start a game and open a question without guidance on a smartphone layout.

+# Feature Specification: JulesJenga
+
+**Feature Branch**: `001-julesjenga`  
+**Created**: 2025-11-29  
+**Status**: Draft  
+**Input**: User description: "Create a mobile-friendly web app (plain HTML/JS/CSS) hosted on Firebase. Uses Firebase Authentication (handled externally) and Firestore. App name: JulesJenga. After login, greet user by name, show Start button, Upload button, dropdown of available question sets (shared between users). Question set = title + exactly 54 questions. Upload: text file where line 1 is title and lines 2–55 are questions; store in Firestore for persistence. Start: go to 6×9 grid numbered 1–54; tapping a tile opens the corresponding question; closing returns to grid; opened tiles marked. Opened tiles do not persist across sessions."
+
+## Clarifications
+
+### Session 2025-11-29
+
+- Q: How should duplicate titles on upload be handled? → A: Allow duplicate titles; each upload creates a distinct set; show creator/timestamp in UI to disambiguate; never overwrite.
+
+## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*
+
+### User Story 1 - Choose and start game (Priority: P1)
+
+As an authenticated user, I want to pick a question set and start the game so I can play immediately.
+
+**Why this priority**: Core entry path for every game session.
+
+**Independent Test**: User can select a set from dropdown, press Start, and reach the grid with the chosen set loaded.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** user is authenticated and at the home screen, **When** they open the dropdown and choose a set, **Then** the selection is reflected and Start becomes enabled.
+2. **Given** a set is selected, **When** the user taps Start, **Then** they see a 6×9 grid labeled 1–54 loaded with that set’s questions (ready to open).
+
+### User Story 2 - Play through tiles (Priority: P1)
+
+As a player, I want to tap tiles to reveal questions and track which tiles were used during this session.
+
+**Why this priority**: Primary gameplay loop.
+
+**Independent Test**: From the grid, user taps any number 1–54, sees the right question, closes it, and the tile shows as used; state resets on reload.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** the grid is displayed, **When** the user taps tile 17, **Then** a modal shows question 17’s text with a close action.
+2. **Given** a question modal is open, **When** the user closes it, **Then** they return to the grid and tile 17 is visibly marked as used while other tiles remain untouched.
+3. **Given** the session ends or the page reloads, **When** the grid reappears, **Then** all tiles are unmarked (session-only state).
+
+### User Story 3 - Upload a question set (Priority: P2)
+
+As a user, I want to upload a text file with 54 questions and a title so it becomes available to everyone.
+
+**Why this priority**: Enables custom/shared content.
+
+**Independent Test**: User uploads a valid file; set appears in dropdown for all users after successful save; malformed files are rejected with clear error.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** the user taps Upload, **When** they select a valid file (55 lines), **Then** the app parses title + 54 questions, saves to Firestore, confirms success, and the new set appears in the dropdown (after refresh or auto-refresh).
+2. **Given** the user selects a file with missing lines, **When** upload is attempted, **Then** the app blocks the upload and shows a specific error (“expected 55 lines: 1 title + 54 questions”).
+3. **Given** network loss during upload, **When** save fails, **Then** the user sees a retry option and no partial set is listed.
+
+### Edge Cases
+
+- File has more or fewer than 55 lines: reject and show precise error.
+- Duplicate titles: allow multiple sets; do not overwrite; disambiguate in UI (e.g., creator/timestamp).
+- Empty lines within the 54 questions: reject with specific error.
+- Long question text: enforce max length (e.g., 280 chars) and validate on upload.
+- Offline at app start: show error and retry; grid unusable without data.

-## Constitution Check
-
-- Code Quality & Maintainability: Plan uses modular JS, lint/format, removes dead code, and enforces small cohesive changes with review.
-- Testing Discipline & Coverage: Unit tests for parsing and state; integration/e2e for upload, selection, and tile flow; regression tests for defects; CI required.
-- User Experience Consistency & Accessibility: Smartphone-first layout, WCAG 2.1 AA focus/contrast/touch targets, consistent modal/dropdown patterns; UX acceptance criteria from spec referenced.
-- Performance & Efficiency Targets: Budgets defined (latency/frame time/upload/save); measurement and rollback via feature flag for risky changes.
-- Decision Traceability & Delivery Governance: Document Firestore schema, upload handling, and security rules in ADR/research; PRs cite principle coverage.

 | Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
 |-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
+
+## Phase 0: Research & Clarifications
+
+- Review spec (`specs/001-julesjenga/spec.md`) and research (`specs/001-julesjenga/research.md`); confirm no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain.
+- Finalize decisions on Firestore schema, duplicate title handling, upload validation thresholds (55 lines, 280-char limit).
+- Document performance/accessibility measurement approach in research.md if further detail needed.
+
+## Phase 1: Design, Data Model, Contracts, Quickstart
+
+- Data model: Validate `specs/001-julesjenga/data-model.md` against spec; ensure question order index 0→tile 1 and duplicate-title policy reflected.
+- Contracts: Align `specs/001-julesjenga/contracts/openapi.yaml` with Firestore usage; add any missing fields (createdBy, timestamps) and sample payloads if needed.
+- Quickstart: Ensure local emulator/hosting steps in `specs/001-julesjenga/quickstart.md` match planned repo structure (`web/`, `tests/`).
+- Security rules: Draft Firestore rules to allow authenticated read/write, prevent overwrite by title collision, and validate array length; link in quickstart.
+- Update plan with any new constraints from design artifacts.
+
+## Phase 2: Implementation & Testing (to be expanded in tasks.md)
+
+- Scaffold project structure (`web/public`, `web/src`, `tests/`).
+- Implement Firebase bootstrap (`web/src/firebase.js`) with config placeholders.
+- UI flow: home screen with greeting, dropdown of sets, Start and Upload buttons; route/state management in `web/src`.
+- Upload flow: client parse/validate 55-line text; show errors; write to Firestore; optional store raw file in Storage; refresh dropdown.
+- Play flow: render 6×9 grid; open modal with question; mark used tiles (session-only); reset on reload.
+- Accessibility: modal focus trap, keyboard/touch navigation, 44px targets, contrast checks.
+- Performance: measure home→grid, modal open, frame timing; optimize if budgets missed.
+- Testing: unit tests for parser/state; integration tests for Firestore read/write flow; e2e for upload, set selection, tile open/close/reset. Ensure CI runs deterministically.

Uses plain HTML/CSS/JS, Firebase Auth (handled externally), and Firestore for shared persistence. Performance and UX budgets: home->grid <1.5s p95 on 4G, modal open <150ms p95, smartphone-first responsive with accessible controls.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (ES2020+ modules)\n**Primary Dependencies**: Firebase JS SDK (Auth handled externally, Firestore, optional Storage for raw uploads), lightweight modal utility (vanilla or minimal helper)\n**Storage**: Firestore collection for QuestionSets; optional Firebase Storage for archived raw text uploads (non-blocking)\n**Testing**: Unit tests for parsing/state (Vitest or Jest); UI/e2e via Playwright; run in CI\n**Target Platform**: Modern browsers on smartphones and desktop\n**Project Type**: Single-page web app (static hosting via Firebase Hosting)\n**Performance Goals**: p95 home->grid <1.5s on 4G; modal open <150ms p95; grid interactions <16ms frame time p95; upload parse <300ms; Firestore save <2s p95\n**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA contrast/focus/touch targets; session-only tile state; shared question sets readable by all authenticated users; offline usage not required (must show graceful errors)\n**Scale/Scope**: Small concurrent usage (dozens to low hundreds); minimal data volume (tens/hundreds of sets)\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n- Code Quality & Maintainability: PASS — modular JS, lint/format, dead-code removal, peer review planned (Phase 2).\n- Testing Discipline & Coverage: PASS — unit + integration + e2e committed (Phase 2 tasks); regression tests for upload parser.\n- User Experience Consistency & Accessibility: PASS — smartphone-first, WCAG 2.1 AA, modal focus trap, 44px targets (Phase 2 tasks).\n- Performance & Efficiency Targets: PASS — budgets defined; measurement tasks in Phase 2; rollback via feature flag noted.\n- Decision Traceability & Delivery Governance: PASS — ADR/research recorded; PRs must cite principle coverage.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-julesjenga/\n+- plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan output)\n+- research.md          # Phase 0 output\n+- data-model.md        # Phase 1 output\n+- quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output\n+- contracts/           # Phase 1 output (OpenAPI/usage)\n+- tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nweb/\n+- public/\n|  +- index.html\n|  +- styles/\n|  +- assets/\n+- src/\n   +- main.js\n   +- firebase.js\n   +- ui/\n   +- state/\n   +- services/\n\ntests/\n+- unit/\n+- integration/\n+- e2e/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Single web app hosted on Firebase Hosting; plain HTML/CSS/JS with Firebase SDK.
